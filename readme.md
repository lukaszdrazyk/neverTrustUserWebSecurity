# Never trust user in case web security
We never should trust anybody on internet. I prepere 3 taks to help you understand why.
### Firstly install environment
```
npm install
npm start
```
Your app should be ready at `localhost:3000`.
### How to make tasks
All code which you need to edit is in file `placeToSolve.js` in main app catalog. Remember to always restart application after your changes. All thinks you need to debug on front Application. Don't look at others files.

### Your task
- Entering website redirect you to strange page, could you fix that? 
- The same guy provide strange link to his page, could you check that?
- Every hour website looks a bit different, where is a problem?

# Have fun and enjoy!
